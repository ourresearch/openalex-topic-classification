# openalex-topic-classification

This repository contains all of the code for getting the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) topic classification model up and running. Go into the model iteration directory (v1) to find a more detailed explanation of how to use this repository. To learn more about topics in OpenAlex, check out [the docs](https://docs.openalex.org/about-the-data/topic). 

### Model Iterations
* v1 (current)

### Model Development
You can find an explanation of the modeling and deployment process at the following link:
[OpenAlex: End-to-End Process for Topic Classification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDopkhuGieQ4F8gGNj7sEc8WSE8mvLZS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103029294098811636573&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### Topics
Works can be tagged with one or more of 4,516 topics, [listed here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v-MAq64x4YjhO7RWcB-yrKV5D_2vOOsxl4u6GBKEXY8/edit?usp=sharing). Each topic is also assigned a domain, field, and subfield that can be used to group similar topics together at a higher level. There is additional data (keywords, summary, wikipedia url) that can be used to help a user see how the clusters are distinguished and what the top words are in each topic.
